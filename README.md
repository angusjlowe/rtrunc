## Installation

First:

```console
git clone https://github.com/angusjlowe/rtrunc.git
```
Then within the cloned directory:

```console
pip install .
```

Or, if you anticipate making changes to the code while using it,
run

```console
pip install -e .
```

Check the (minimal) tests pass by running

```console
python -m pytest tests/
```

If this works, you should be good to go!
